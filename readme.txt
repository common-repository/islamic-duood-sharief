اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ
.إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ
اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ
.إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ

He who reads a single Durood upon me, Almighty Allah blesses him ten times, ten of his sins are forgiven, and he is increased ten times in stages (internally)

Divine blessings on Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim) is the highest and the most meritorious act in our Deen. This "Divine Blessings" is called Durood Shareef.

When Almighty Allah sends Durood and Salaams upon Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim), He is actually blessing him. When the Malaa'ikah and the Muslims send Durood and Salaams to Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim), they are actually showing Almighty Allah their respect for the Holy Prophet (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim).

Muslims hope that, through the blessings of the Durood and Salaams, Almighty Allah will forgive them of their sins and increase their status in this world and in the Aakirah. The Malaa'ikah hope that Almighty Allah will increase their status.

Durood is a sure means of Allah Ta'ala granting blessings, peace, prosperity and favours of great magnitude on one who recites Durood Shareef on the Holy Prophet (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim). The reciter of Durood Shareef receives all the benefits in this world and utmost gain in the next world with addition to the love of the Holy Prophet (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim).

The invocation of Blessings on the Holy Prophet (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim) is styled in Arabic as "Salawat", in Persian as "Durood", and in Urdu as "Salawat-o-Salaam".

The regular recitation of Durood Shareef on Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim) lifts up our hearts on to a plane of comprehension where we gaze in our new found peace and moral armour.

The reciter of Durood Shareef will, after some time, come to realise by himself that it is the spontaneous outpouring of his heart before the Great Prophet (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim) of Islam, whose love and attachment is needed to get all the present day problems solved and obtain mercy in the next world.

The more Durood Shareef we recite, the greater the gain and benefit will be achieved in both the worlds. Hazrat Shaikh-e-Akbar Mo'inuddin ibn Arabi (radi Allahu anhu) has stated that, "Those who claim to love and revere the Holy Prophet (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim) should increase their recital of the Durood Shareef in patience and perseverance until, through the mercy of Rasoolullah (Sallal Laahu Alaihi Wasallim), they have the opportunity of witnessing his blessed countenance".

The special and exclusive aspect of this prayer is that Durood Shareef is immediately accepted by Allah Ta'ala. No one can doubt its acceptance, as Durood Shareef is being recited by Allah Ta'ala too. Not only this, but He has revealed this secret in the Holy Quran by saying:
